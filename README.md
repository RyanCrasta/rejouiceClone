# Rejouice Clone (https://rejouice.com/)

I cloned Rejouice landing page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In the process of building it, I got to know about GSAP, SwiperJS, and LocomotiveJS. 

LocomotiveJS: Smooth effect while scrolling comes from this library.  

SwiperJS : To create an interactive image slider. 

GSAP: Text reveal effect made using this library. If you want to animate elements inside your web app GSAP will serve you well.
